        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Alexandra was born and raised in North Texas. She married her high school sweetheart and has two younger sisters. Alexandra is currently in a period of 	exciting transition, as this will be her final year teaching in Keller ISD. After many fulfilling years in education, she is moving into a new chapter of her 	professional life.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Alexandra earned her Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education from Texas Woman’s University, where she cultivated a deep passion for teaching and 	child development.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Alexandra has spent much of her career as an elementary school teacher in the local Keller ISD. Alongside her teaching, she has been exploring other 	professional avenues, balancing part-time roles that allow her to pursue her interests outside the classroom.
	Recently, Alexandra has begun to transition out of full-time teaching. She is growing her role as a roofing sales consultant, helping clients with home 	improvement projects while learning the business from the ground up. Her entrepreneurial spirit is also evident in her yoga practice, which she has been 	steadily expanding. Alexandra teaches yoga classes both locally and during her annual women’s retreat in Baja, Mexico, where she leads immersive sessions and 	workshops focused on wellness, mindfulness, and empowerment.
	This blend of education, business, and wellness demonstrates Alexandra’s versatile skills, commitment to personal growth, and dedication to helping others; 	whether in the classroom, through yoga, or in her budding sales career.</p>
