            <p>Something else I've been doing since I was a child. I prefer surf fishing or using a kayak on the bay side or in the flats, but will fish anywhere. Fresh water or Salt.</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>So this might age me, but I was a competitive gamer when Halo was THE game to play. Along with Counter-Strike back then. But Halo was the one that I actuallly traveled to 	    tournaments for.</p>
