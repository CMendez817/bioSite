        <h2>What Alexandra Does in Her Down Time</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Background & Fitness</h3>
            <p>Alexandra is committed to maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle, blending physical fitness with mindfulness and wellness practices. She 	    	    incorporates regular workouts and training into her routine, preparing for new challenges and races that test her endurance and resilience. This year, 	    she is excited to participate in the inaugural CoolerN' Hell Gravel Race in Wichita Falls, a challenging event that combines long-distance cycling 	    	    with rugged terrain, requiring both strength and strategy.</p>

            <h3>Wellness & Recovery</h3>
            <p>To support her body through rigorous training and her daily activities, Alexandra has incorporated infrared sauna sessions into her wellness routine. 	    Unlike traditional steam saunas, infrared saunas use light to heat the body directly, penetrating deeper into muscles and joints, which can aid in faster 	    recovery, improved circulation, and reduced inflammation. Regular sessions also promote detoxification, relaxation, and stress reduction, providing a 	    holistic benefit to both her physical and mental well-being.</p>

        <div>
            <p>By integrating infrared sauna therapy with her yoga practice, strength training, and endurance preparation, Alexandra is able to maintain peak 	  	    performance while protecting her body from overtraining and injury. Her commitment to wellness reflects her proactive approach to health, her dedication 	    to personal growth, and her readiness to embrace new challenges—like the CoolerN' Hell Gravel Race—with energy, focus, and enthusiasm.</p>
